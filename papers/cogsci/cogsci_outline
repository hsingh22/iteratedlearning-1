CogSci Outline:

Introduction:
  1. Languages change
  2. Why do languages change?
      -pressure to be descriptive (towards complexity)
      -pressure to be transmitted (towards simplicity)
      -these pressures act in everyday interactions
  3. Adults and children are different at learning languages; pressures may play differently
      -WM
      -kids good at learning language
      -experience
      -social aspect (who talking to)
        -subject to feedback and error correction; adults able to disambiguate better

Iterated Learning:
  4. Used to study artificial language learning in lab (b/c hard to observe)
      -basic ILL paradigm and process
      -basic ILL findings (Kirby)
  5. But, adults aren't usually teaching each other language.. kids are the usual learners
      -Kempe paper
  6. But, this doesn't account for feedback & error correction
      -importance of error correction and parental feedback
      
7. Attempt to resolve these errors by allowing for condition in the iterated process, see the relationship between complexity and simplicity here -- do editors help? how much? 
  -how much put in w/kids because kids don't have 
      
Methods:
  1. Two conditions: baseline & dyad
      -explain; just adults for now
  2. Participants online on mTurk in both conditions n's and stuff
      -initial and then replication with 12 gens and 40 chains
  3. Describe task
  
  Analysis:
  4. Describe how measured % accuracy
  5. Describe how measured complexity
      -algorithmic, chunking, edge length, need to mention earth-mover(?)
      -cite Gauvrit & Kempe
      
Results:
  1. Baseline Experiment:
    -% accuracy increased significantly 
    -complexity decreased (in all complexity measures) & asymptoted 
    
  2. Dyad Experiment: 
    -% accuracy relatively stable, different for group
    -tradeoff/bounce with reintroducing complexity
    -complexity decreased faster
  
  3. Comparing plots from both experiments
    -higher level of complexity retained when editor present; asymptoted sooner
  
Discussion (*probably want some more):
  1. Languages in this thing are reflecting tradeoff between pressures similar to parents and kids
  2. People who correct serve a majorly important purpose: they help the language as a whole

Future Directions:
  1. Ongoing work with children at MSI
  2. Qualitative analysis to see if errors are fundamentally different (argument for studying actual children in ILL studies)
  3. Structure task
